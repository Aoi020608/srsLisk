# Options

## Styles of Options

There are 2 primary types of vanilla option contracts.

- American Options
  Give the holder the right, but not the obligation to exercise up until the expiration date.

- European Options
  Give the holder the right, but not the obligation to exercise at the time of expiration.

## Calls & Puts

- Call
  Buyers of call options generally expect the underlying asset to increase in value, whereas sellers of calls expect a decrease in value, or for the value to remain the same.

- Put
  Buyers of put options generally expect the underlying asset to decrease in value, whereas sellers of puts expect an increase in value or for the value to remain the same.

## Option Strategies

- Covered Call
  An option strategy executed by selling a call option while holding the same underlying asset. This strategy is generally used if you expect the underlying asset price to stay relatively flat of increase moderately.

- Secured Put
  An option strategy composed of selling a put option while retaining enough cash to purchase the underlying asset if the option contract is exeuted by its buyer. This strategy is generally used if you are bearish on an asset short term, but bullish long term.

- Bull Call Spread
  A Bull Call Spread is an option strategy that you can utilize if you think the price of the underlying asset will go up, but not by much. To execute this strategy, you use two call options to form a price range with a lower and higher strike price.

- Bear Put Spread
  The Bear Put Spread can be used when you are expecting a moderate to significant drop in an asset's price, and you want to reduce the cost and risk associated with your trade. Similar to the Bull call Spread, this strategy is achieved by using two separate put options.

- Protective Collar
  When market volatility picks up drastically, and you are not sure what's going to happen, you can utilize this strategy. With this strategy you can protect yourself from short term downside losses, while also retaining the ability to make money if price goes up.

- Long Straddle
  This strategy is typically used when traders expect a news event to move the price of a particular asset. To execute this strategy, you would purchase both a call and a put with the same expiration date and strike price. Since the strike price is ATM of close it, small moves in either direction are essentially canceled out.

- Long Strangle
  This strategy is nearly identical to the Long Straddle strategy except for 2 key differences. Rather than purchasing an ATM call and an ATM put, you would purchase an OTM call and an OTM put. Also, rather than having the same strike price, the call and put you purchase for this strategy will have different strike prices. They will still have the same expiration date.
